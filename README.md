# Supporting a Sustainable and Inclusive Urban Agriculture Federation using Dashboarding - Online material 

This repository contains the online material of the article "Supporting a Sustainable and Inclusive Urban
Agriculture Federation using Dashboarding", submitted to ICT4S 2025. 

## Repository structure

- `/kpis`: Folder containing the current version of the eleven KPIs.
- `/specification`: Folder containing the specification document for the initial implementation of the data gathering part. 


Note: The documents are anonymized for the review

Note2: Some targets are still preliminary

## Explanation of the IDs

To allow for easier referencing to the KPIs and measures used, some ids were created according to the following logic:
- The first letter indicates whether it is a KPI (K) or a measure (M)
- The second and ev. third letter(s) indicate(s) where the KPI was originally created (initial of the city or C for common), or whether it is a common (C), control (CC) or specific (S) measure
- A number identifying the KPI or measure. The numbers are unique for the same combination of preceeding letters
- For KPIs or measures that are variations or subsets of the same, additional letters/numbers are added

For example, KC1 is a KPI (starts with K), created in common by all LLs (second letter is C) and it is the first one of the common KPIs so it gets a 1. 

Another example, MC11-1 (Production sales) is a measure (starts with M) which is gathered by all LLs (common, second letter is C) and it is a subset of Sales (all sales measures starts with MC11).
